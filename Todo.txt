1- //////// To be as a class for generic files 
2- //////// Need three class 1 mother and two daughters , one for suthetic graphs the other one to extract from the DB
3- //////// To complete displat for type 1 simulation
4- /////// To have statistical analysis nodes metrics and rumor impact
5- Add nodes metrics to the DB
6- ///// To implement RIM strategy
        - Randon blocking node
        - max degree
        - max beta
        - max centrality
        
7- ////// Add and option ToSave_results
8- ///// Generate for each Sythetic (AB,Free-scale,Random) graphe method 3 graphs (small n=100, medium n=1000 and large n=5000)
9- ////// Take in consederation the k value blocked node
10-/////// find better solution to block nodes 
11- Think about the framework architecture


13- Neo4j Les doublant
14- multi processing
15- prepa
16- all Simulation results should be plot in simulation results 

17- ///////// all variables names(k)
18- ///////// Tdet verification
18- //////// applyRim function out of the loop for
19- //////// Display function for lot of methods
